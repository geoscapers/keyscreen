To run this demo you need a linux machine (tested on ubuntu 16.04) and a logitech G810 keyboard with nordic layout.
(It will probably run on other logitech keyboards supported by keyleds as well, but then the config file needs to be changed for a different layout)

To run the demo, follow theese steps:

1. Install keyleds https://github.com/keyleds/keyleds following their instructions

2. Move the file keyledsd.conf from this archive to $HOME/.config 

3. Move the file nappisdemo.lua from this archive to $HOME/.local/share/keyledsd/effects

4. Swap around keycaps on your keyboard so that the keycaps higlighted in the image keycap-layout.jpg are in the right places

5. Run the script keyscreen.sh (please note that the music file keyscreenSound.wav needs to be in the same folder as the script).

6. Stop the demo with Ctrl-C after the music stops.
